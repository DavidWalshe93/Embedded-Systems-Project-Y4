# Embedded-Systems-Project-Y4


# This project was undertaken as part of my "Embedded Systems" module during my 4th year studies. 

# The project brief was to create a RTC embedded device that hosted various other features such a stopwatch, timer, 
# localization timing for different time zones and calender functionality. 

# On a more technical decription this project made us of the Freescale(NXP) KL26Z Freedom board which hosts a ARM 32-bit core. 
# In this project I made use of numerous embedded perphirals such as a dedicated RTC, interrupts and timers.

# This project took me 4 weeks to complete.
